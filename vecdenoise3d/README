# DESCRIPTION AND LICENCE

This is an implementation of the vector-field denoising algorithm described in
the following papers:

P. D. Tafti and M. Unser, On regularized reconstruction of vector fields, IEEE
Trans. Image Process., vol. 20, no. 11, pp. 3163–78, 2011.

The code is provided freely for non-commercial and educational use, but
WITHOUT ANY GUARANTEES OF ANY KIND.  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. :-)

If you use this code or derivatives of it, or results obtained using the code
or its derivatives in publications, we would appreciate references to the
above two papers (the first being more important).  In addition, we request
that you do not re-distribute this code or derivatives of it without our
consent and permission.


# USE WITH YOUR OWN DATA

To use with your own data, you will need to provide a .mat file with the
following variables:

name:   (string) name of the dataset
Y1:     (3D array) measurements of the 1st vector coordinate over a Cartesian
        grid
Y2:     (3D array) measurements of the 2nd vector coordinate over a Cartesian
        grid
Y3:     (3D array) measurements of the 3rd vector coordinate over a Cartesian
        grid

Y1, Y2, and Y3 must have the same size.  The grid is assumed to be uniform,
but need not have the same size in all dimensions.

If you have the ground truth in addition to the noisy data, you can optionally
use it by providing a second .mat file with the same format.


# EXECUTION

The main script is demo.m.  All important parameters are set by the user (with
defaults provided) at the time of execution, with the exception of optimizer
parameters which are hard-coded in setparams.m, and the save path and email
address for updates (optional), which must be set at the top of demo.m.  If you
wish to receive email updates, you will also need to set the mail server
parameters in send_mail.m.


# VISUALIZATION

Input and outputs can be saved as .VTK files and visualized using the free
software package ParaView:
